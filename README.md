# Linear-Algebra-Library-in-C-
This code was developed for the 'C++ for scientific computing' elective as part of the MSc in Mathematical Modeling and Scientific Computing at the University of Oxford. 

The report included gives a thorough description of the project and the code produced. The Matrix and Vector class together with a library of friend functions are capable of a wide array of numerical linear algebra and in particular, solving linear systems of equations, of the form Ax = b. 

The Convergence.cpp file was used to produce the data and results shown in the report. 

The use_vectors.cpp file is a mess, but was used to test parts of each function as the code was developed.
